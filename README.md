# Discord-Harmony ping
Test minion bot for the [core](https://github.com/discord-harmony/core). To install you should first setup the [core](https://github.com/discord-harmony/core) and then navigate to the `minions` directory. From within that directory pull down this repository. Then run the `npm install` command from within this repository. Before you can run anything you'll need to create a `.env` file that contains the bots discord token in the following format:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN="<Bots token>"
```

You can then follow the instructions on how to start the [core](https://github.com/discord-harmony/core). Since it will manage this bot there is no need to manually start this bot.
